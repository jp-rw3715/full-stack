          Tensions between India and Pakistan have escalated after the deadly
          terrorist attack in Pahalgam, Kashmir, on April 22, 2025, which
          claimed the lives of 28 civilians. India accuses Pakistan-backed
          militants of orchestrating the attack, while Pakistan denies the
          allegations.
        </p>
        <p>
          On May 7, India launched "Operation Sindoor," involving airstrikes
          against terrorist targets in Pakistan. The strikes hit sites in
          Bahawalpur and Muridke, and Pakistan retaliated with missile attacks
          on Indian military installations.

          The international community is deeply concerned about the conflict’s
          potential to escalate into a full-scale war, with both countries being
          nuclear powers.
