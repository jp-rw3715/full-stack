    <h1>SHIVAJI MAHARAJ</h1>
    <p>
      <b>Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj</b> was born in the hill fort of
      <u>Shivneri</u>, close to the town of Junnar, which is currently in the
      Pune district. The Maharashtra government has designated February 19 as a
      holiday to commemorate Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj’s birth known as
      Shivaji Jayanti.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was given the name ‘Shivaji’ after the goddess
      Shivai, a local deity. Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj’s father, Maratha
      general Shahaji Bhonsle, served the Deccan Sultanates. His mother was
      Jijabai, the child of Lakhuji Jadhavrao of Sindhkhed, who descended from
      the Devagiri Yadav royal family. Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj belonged to
      the Maratha Bhonsle clan. Maloji (1552 – 1597), his grandfather, was a
      powerful general in the Ahmadnagar Sultanate who was given the title
      “Raja”.
    </p>
    <p>
      For military expenditures, he was granted the Deshmukhi rights of Pune,
      Supe, Chakan, and Indapur. He was also provided Fort Shivneri as a
      residence for his family (circa 1590). At the moment of Chhatrapati
      Shivaji Maharaj’s birth, three Islamic sultanates held power in the
      Deccan: Bijapur, Ahmednagar, and Golkonda. Shahaji frequently switched
      allegiances between the Nizamshahi of Ahmadnagar, the Adilshah of Bijapur,
      and the Mughals, but he maintained his jagir (fiefdom) in Pune and his
      small army.
