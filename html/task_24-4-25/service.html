    Grocery shopping services encompass both traditional brick-and-mortar stores and increasingly popular online platforms, each offering distinct benefits and services. 
    Online grocery services provide convenience, competitive pricing, and flexible delivery options, while traditional stores offer immediate access and sometimes lower prices on select items. 
Traditional Grocery Stores (Brick-and-Mortar):
Selection:
Generally, supermarkets offer a wider variety of products, including non-food items, compared to smaller grocery stores. 
Price:
While some individual items in traditional stores might be cheaper, supermarkets often have lower prices due to their buying power. 
Customer Service:
Personalized attention, bargaining opportunities, and credit options are strengths of local kirana stores, according to Statista [1]. 
Physical Experience:
Customers enjoy the immediate access to items and the ability to inspect products before purchasing. 
Online Grocery Services:
Convenience:
Online services allow customers to shop from anywhere and have groceries delivered directly to their homes, notes a report from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) [7].
Pricing and Discounts:
Online platforms often offer competitive pricing, promotions, and discounts, says Statista [1].
Delivery Options:
Flexible delivery options, such as same-day, scheduled, or slotted deliveries, are common.
Technology:
Online stores utilize user-friendly apps and websites, personalized recommendations, and subscription options.
Quick Commerce:
Some online grocery retailers have adopted a quick commerce model for faster deliveries, sometimes within minutes, according to Statista [1].
